# -iOS-Exploitation-Techniques

## Introduction:
This repository demonstrates several techniques used in iOS exploitation, including buffer overflows, kernel exploits, and Secure Enclave bypass methods. These examples are meant to provide insights into how attackers can leverage vulnerabilities in the iOS system.

Below are some example codes and brief explanations for each technique.

### Buffer Overflow Example:
This code demonstrates a simple buffer overflow vulnerability in C. Such vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to manipulate memory and execute unauthorized code.
[Buffer Overflow Code](./buffer_overflow.c)

### Kernel Exploit Example:
The following is a simplified example that conceptually demonstrates a kernel exploit in iOS. In practice, kernel exploits are more complex and require deep knowledge of the system's architecture.
[Kernel Exploit Code](./kernel_exploit.c)

### Secure Enclave Bypass Example:
This code illustrates the concept of bypassing the Secure Enclave, which is a critical part of iOS security responsible for protecting sensitive data.
